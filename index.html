      <p1>Hello. If you are looking for a clock here it is! You might be waiting for the seconds count down before the end of a test, or social event, but remember, don't sit counting. You have limited time on this planet, so make use of it. Don't complain later that you didn't have enough time. So do what whatever you want, before it is too late.</p1>
